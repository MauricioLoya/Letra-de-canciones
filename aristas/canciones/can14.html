			It's always around me, all this noise, but <br> Not nearly as loud as the voice saying<br> "Let it happen, let it happen<br>
			<br><br> (It's gonna feel so good)<br> Just let it happen, let it happen"<br>
			<br> All this running around<br> Trying to cover my shadow<br> A notion growing inside<br> Now all the others seem shallow<br> All this running around<br> Bearing down on my shoulders<br> I can hear an alarm<br> It must be morning<br>
			<br> I heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round<br> It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound, and<br> When it happens, when it happens<br> (I won't be holding on)<br> So let it happen, let it happen<br>
			<br> All this running around<br> I can't fight it much longer<br> Something's tryin' to get out<br> And it's never been closer<br> If my take-off fails<br> Make up some other story<br> But if I never come back<br> Tell my mother I'm sorry<br>
			<br> (Gibberish)
			<br>
			<br><br> Baby, now I'm ready, moving on<br> Oh, but maybe I was ready all along<br> Oh, I'm ready for the moment and the sound<br> Oh, but maybe I was ready all along<br> Baby, now I'm ready, moving on<br> Oh, but maybe I was ready all along<br> Oh,
			I'm ready for the moment and the sound<br> Oh, but maybe I was ready all along<br>
