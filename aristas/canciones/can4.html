				Off work in the morning <br> Up at the crack of dawn<br> All my money worries<br> Wherever I go come along<br>
				<br> Worrys a bully<br> That just won't let me be<br> Trying to keep me busy<br> Tussling and struggling<br>
				<br> No home since the fire<br> Me and the ashtray can't settle down<br> I'm sure of where I'm bound<br> So I sink another round<br>
				<br> Placebo for pain<br> And there's no one for to blame<br> I refuse to accept<br> That my work is all in vain<br>
				<br> Worrys a bully<br> That just won't let me be<br> Trying to keep me busy<br> Tussling and struggling<br>
				<br> Still always remembering<br> When the going gets tuff<br> That the labor of our love<br> Will reward us soon enough<br>
				<br> Still always remembering<br> When the going gets tuff<br> That the labor of our love<br> Will reward us soon enough<br>
				<br> Man's never alone<br> If he can offer help<br> Always thinking of<br> Everyone else before himself<br>
				<br> Worrys a bully<br> That just won't let me be<br> Trying to keep me busy<br> Tussling and struggling<br>
