I, I will be king <br>

And you, you will be queen<br>
<br>
Though nothing will drive them away<br>
We can beat them, just for one day<br>
We can be Heroes, just for one day<br>
<br>
And you, you can be mean<br>
And I, I'll drink all the time<br>
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact<br>
Yes we're lovers, and that is that<br>
Though nothing, will keep us together<br>
We could steal time, just for one day<br>
We can be Heroes, for ever and ever<br>
What'd you say?<br>
<br>
I, I wish you could swim<br>
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim<br>
Though nothing<br>
Nothing will keep us together<br>
We can beat them, for ever and ever<br>
Oh we can be Heroes, just for one day<br>
<br>
I, I will be king<br>
And you, you will be queen<br>
Though nothing will drive them away<br>
We can be Heroes, just for one day<br>
We can be all us, just for one day<br>
<br>
I, I can remember (I remember)<br><br>
<br>
Standing by the wall<br>
(By the wall)<br>
And the guns shot above our heads (over our heads)<br>
And we kissed as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)<br>
And the shame was on the other side<br>
<br>
Oh we can beat them, for ever and ever<br>
Then we could be Heroes, just for one day<br>
<br>
We can be Heroes<br>
We can be Heroes<br>
We can be Heroes<br>
Just for one day<br>
We can be Heroes<br>
We're nothing, and nothing will help us<br>
Maybe we're lying<br>
Then you better not stay<br>
But we could be safer<br>
Just for one day<br>
Oh-oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh-ohh just for one day<br>
