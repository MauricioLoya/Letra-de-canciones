Ground Control to Major Tom <br>
Ground Control to Major Tom <br>
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on <br>
 <br>
Ground Control to Major Tom (Ten, nine, eight, seven, six) <br>
 <br>
Commencing countdown, engines on (Five, four, three, two) <br>
Check ignition and may God's love be with you (Two, one, liftoff) <br>
 <br>
This is Ground Control to Major Tom <br>
You've really made the grade <br>
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear <br>
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare <br>
 <br>
This is Major Tom to Ground Control <br>
I'm stepping through the door <br>
And I'm floating in the most peculiar way <br>
And the stars look very different today <br>
 <br>
For here am I sitting in my tin can <br>
Far above the world <br>
Planet Earth is blue <br>
And there's nothing I can do <br>
 <br>
Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles <br>
I'm feeling very still <br>
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go <br>
Tell my wife I love her very much, she knows <br>
 <br>
Ground Control to Major Tom <br>
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong <br>
Can you hear me, Major Tom? <br>
Can you hear me, Major Tom? <br>
Can you hear me, Major Tom? <br>
Can you hear- <br> <br>
 <br>
And I'm floating around my tin can <br>
Far above the Moon <br>
Planet Earth is blue <br>
And there's nothing I can do <br>
