Well, he feels like an elephant <br>
Shaking his big grey trunk for the hell of it<br>
He knows that you're dreaming about being loved by him<br>
<br>
Too bad your chances are slim<br>
<br>
And it's not like Mr. Shuck to get shy when I ask him who is on top<br>
There must be something deep down in the dark down there<br>
But he's not too easily scared<br>
<br>
He's got friends but they got the fear<br>
<br>
Wouldn't care too much if he just disappeared<br>
Oh look, see there he is now coming down the stairs<br>
Here he comes<br>
<br>
He pulled the mirrors off his Cadillac<br>
â€˜Cause he doesn't like it looking like he looks back<br>
He talks like his opinion is a simple fact<br>
Somebody grabbed his collar<br>
He cried the whole way home<br>
No one remembered a thing when they saw him again<br>
That's how it is 'til the end<br>
Yeah<br>
