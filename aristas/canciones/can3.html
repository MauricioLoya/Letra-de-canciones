			She lives in pans at the end of this prison <br> The love sprouts from the decay<br> The night's pulsing, streets are convulsing<br> Dark libations through the bray<br>
			<br> I stop trying to make sense of it all<br> Start sniffing around the continous strife<br> Grab fear by a strange hand<br> Sweet neglection in her own right<br>
			<br> I wouldn't change a<br> I love her just the way she is<br> I'll love her flaws and friends<br> Don't care what anybody says about her<br>
			<br> she has a spear and a vow of mother noture<br> You'll never know what she'll do<br> Hardened from her mysterious sun<br> I'm not a muse, I play the fool<br>
			<br> I stop trying to make sense of it all<br> Start dancing around the continous strife<br> Grab fear by a strange hand<br> Keep her cool under the pale moonlight<br>
			<br> I wouldn't change a<br> I love her just the way she is<br> I'll love her flaws and friends<br> Don't care what anybody says<br>
			<br> I wouldn't change a<br> I love her just the way she is<br> I'll love her flaws and friends<br> Don't care what anybody says about her<br>
