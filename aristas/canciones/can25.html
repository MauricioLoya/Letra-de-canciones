				I still don't know what I was waiting for <br> And my time was running wild<br> A million dead-end streets<br>
				<br> Every time I thought I'd got it made<br> It seemed the taste was not so sweet<br> So I turned myself to face me<br> But I've never caught a glimpse<br> Of how the others must see the faker<br> I'm much too fast to take that test<br>
				<br> Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
				<br> (Turn and face the strange)<br> Ch-ch-changes
				<br> Don't want to be a richer man<br> Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
				<br> (Turn and face the strange)<br> Ch-ch-changes
				<br> Just gonna have to be a different man<br> Time may change me<br> But I can't trace time<br>
				<br> II watch the ripples change their size <br> But never leave the stream <br> Of warm impermanence and <br> So the days float through my eyes <br> But still the days seem the same <br> And these children that you spit on <br> As they try to change
				their worlds <br> Are immune to your consultations <br> They're quite aware of what they're going through <br>
				<br> Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes <br> <br> (Turn and face the strange) <br> Ch-ch-changes <br> Don't tell them to grow up and out of it <br> Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes <br> (Turn and face the strange) <br> Ch-ch-changes <br> Where's your shame <br> You've left us
				up to our necks in it <br> Time may change me <br> But you can't trace time <br>
				<br> Strange fascination, fascinating me <br> Changes are taking the pace <br> I'm going through <br>
				<br> Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes <br> (Turn and face the strange) <br> Ch-ch-changes <br> Oh, look out you rock 'n rollers <br> Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes <br> (Turn and face the strange) <br> Ch-ch-changes
				<br> Pretty soon now you're gonna get older<br> Time may change me<br> But I can't trace time<br> I said that time may change me<br> But I can't trace time<br>
