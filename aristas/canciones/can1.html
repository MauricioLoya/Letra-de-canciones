				Too soon, wanted more time <br> Could've held out, but your clock was ticking<br> No easing in, straightened out lines<br> Alone with your thoughts<br> 'Cause your friends are still in<br>
				<br> Night clubs and back rooms<br> Baggies in the bathrooms<br> Nothing's changed but you<br> Saying nothing's missing<br> Thoughts are drifting away from you<br>
				<br> Morning sun fills the void<br> Now you see there never was a point<br>
				<br> Over and over and over again<br> 'Till you can no longer pretend you are sane<br> Try but you couldn't get any more sure<br> And the ending still will never change<br>
				<br> Tomorrow night'll go on without you<br> Go on without you there<br> Tomorrow night'll go on without you<br> 'Till dawn and no one will care<br>
				<br> You can't know, it's a move in the dark<br> Hesitation leaves you hung on the lip<br> Unclench your teeth<br> Peel off the smile<br> See no one there, and you release your grip<br>
				<br> Night clubs and back rooms<br> Baggies in the bathrooms<br> Nothing's changed but you<br> Saying nothing's missing<br> Thoughts are drifting away from you<br>
				<br> Led the beast to the cliff<br> One more step and a long way down<br> The morning sun fills the void<br> Now you see there never was a point<br>
				<br> Over and over and over again<br> 'Till you can no longer pretend you are sane<br> Try but you couldn't get any more sure<br> And the ending still will never change<br>
