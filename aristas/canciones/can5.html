		Yes, I'm only a man <br>
Judgements of something ancient<br>
Clocking my time as finished<br>
The same is all replacements<br>
Ignorance is complacency<br>
Why are you purposely fading?<br>
No stand, no sit, no stopping<br>
Ripping through the neon prophecies<br>
Got let off by a ticket stub<br>
My time is fading fast<br>
Through your mouth and out yours'<br>
<br>
(You never do what you say)<br>
Say what?<br>
(Shine till the sun comes up)<br>
Come down<br>
(You oughta wash your hands and pray)<br>
For what?<br>
(Shaking hands, swapping dirty blood)<br>
Pass it round<br>
(You never do what you say)<br>
Say what?<br>
(Shine till the sun comes up)<br>
For now<br>
(You promise that you'll come around?)<br>
I'll be around<br>
So I fear, but I don't know what it is<br>
So I want, but I pretend I don't need<br>
So here's the pain of the stubbled lover's kiss<br>
I throw my pages all away like shaking wrists<br>
<br>
So shake me down<br>
Shake me up (shake me down, shake me down)<br>
So shake me up<br>
<br>
(You never do what you say)<br>
Say what?<br>
(Shine till the sun comes up)<br>
Hey now<br>
(You oughta wash your hands and pray)<br>
For what?<br>
(Shaking hands, swapping dirty blood)<br>
Pass it round<br>
(You never do what you say)<br>
Say what?<br>
(Shine till the sun comes up)<br>
Come down<br>
(You promise that you'll come around?)<br>
I'll be around<br>
<br>
I tell me it ain't hard<br>
As I hold my breath [?]<br>
Tell me to my beating heart<br>
That I know for sure<br>
(Shake me up, shake me down, shake me down)<br>
Better than I can know for sure<br>
(Shake me up, shake me down, shake me down)<br>
What it did<br>
(Shake me up, shake me down, shake me down)<br>
My mistakes bend like payphone metal<br>
(Shake me up, shake me down, shake me down)<br>
I never know just what will come<br>
(Shake me up, shake me down, shake me down)<br>
As our [?] hands bind together<br>
(Shake me up, shake me down, shake me down)<br>
River and me children<br>
(Shake me up, shake me down, shake me down)<br>
Longer than [?]<br>
(Shake me up, shake me down, shake me down)<br>
Get what I am given, forever<br>
(Shake me up, shake me down, shake me down)<br>
(So shake me up)<br>
<br>
(You never do what you say)<br>
Say what?<br>
(Shine till the sun comes up)<br>
Come down<br>
(You oughta wash your hands and pray)<br>
For what?<br>
(Shaking hands, swapping dirty blood)<br>
Pass it round<br>
(You never do what you say)<br>
Say what?<br>
(Shine till the sun comes up)<br>
For now<br>
(You promise that you'll come around?)<br>
